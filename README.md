# Embryonic Pattern Formation

## Experiment_Analysis\

- Tracking.py\
  Summary: \
  Takes data output
  takes csv file generated using btrack library, and creates gif depicting (x,y) positions
- Experiment_Data\
- Plots\

## Simulations\

- Simulations_V2.ipynb\
  Summary:  
  Creates a gif simulating interspecies attraction\repulsion dynamics. The simulation considers a region of influence, cell size, initial populations, and probability of division modeled through by the gamma probability distribution function.

  Parameters:

  - Attraction rates
  - cell size
  - initial cell count
  - $k$ and $\theta$ for cell division probability \
    **to do: needs depend on species**
  - region of influence
